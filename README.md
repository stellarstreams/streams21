Website for Streams 21 conference

TO DO

1. Add more images (currently Adrian's M31 used as a placeholder in lots of places) and check credit for images.
2. Some formatting issues with side-by-side text and images
3. If can be bothered, try to improve layout on smaller screens. Currently the logo doesn't scale with window size. Also images probably too big on a phone.
